Hello future employer, this is my portfolio, hope you enjoy looking through it as much as I enjoyed creating it! 
Loading my portfolio, you will see my name, a recent picture of me, and links to the specified sections.
When you click the links, they scroll to their section.
When you click "My Linkedin Profile" and "My Twitter Account" they both link to their specified accounts.
When you click the "My Application" image, it links to an application (the Horiseon website), you can scroll up and down as well.
When you resize the website, it resizes and adapts.
